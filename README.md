---

Play Coup with 2–6 friends from any device — no app install, no accounts. Create a room, share the code, and start bluffing. The server enforces every rule so nobody can cheat, and the mobile-first UI keeps the game moving with timed challenge and block windows.

## Features

### Multiplayer
- **Real-time WebSocket gameplay** — instant action broadcasts via Socket.io
- **Server-authoritative** — all game logic runs server-side; clients never see hidden cards
- **Room codes** — 6-character codes for easy sharing, no accounts required
- **Computer players** — add 1–5 AI opponents with 3 difficulty tiers (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- **Reconnection** — drop and rejoin mid-game without losing your seat
- **Auto-cleanup** — stale rooms expire after 24 hours

### Game Rules
- **Complete 2012 base game** — Income, Foreign Aid, Tax, Steal, Assassinate, Exchange, Coup
- **Full challenge system** — any player can call a bluff; failed challenges cost an influence
- **Block and counter-block** — Duke blocks Foreign Aid, Contessa blocks Assassination, Captain/Ambassador block Steal
- **Forced Coup** — 10+ coins means you must Coup
- **Timed responses** — 15-second windows for challenges and blocks keep the pace up

### Interface
- **Mobile-first** — portrait-optimized touch UI with 48px+ tap targets
- **Dark theme** — character-colored cards with role icons
- **Phase status banner** — always shows what's happening and what you need to do
- **Urgency-coded prompts** — red for threats (assassination), gold for decisions, gray for waiting
- **Action log** — scrollable history of every action, challenge, and block

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+ (LTS recommended)

## Getting Started

```sh
git clone https://github.com/8tp/Coup.git
cd Coup
npm install
npm run dev
```

The server starts at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Open it in multiple browser tabs to test multiplayer.

### How to Play

1. Click **Create Room** and enter your name
2. Share the 6-character room code with friends
3. Friends click **Join Room** and enter the code
4. Optionally, the host can click **Add Computer Player** to fill seats with AI opponents
5. The host clicks **Start Game** once 2–6 players have joined
6. Bluff, challenge, and eliminate your way to victory

### Computer Players

The host can add AI opponents from the lobby. Each bot has a difficulty level:

| Difficulty | Bluffing | Challenges | Targeting | Strategy |
|------------|----------|------------|-----------|----------|
| **Easy** | Never bluffs | Never challenges | Random | Plays honestly — only uses cards it holds |
| **Medium** | ~30% chance | ~20% chance | 50% targets leader | Occasional bluffs and challenges |
| **Hard** | Strategic | Card counting | Always targets leader | Bluffs Contessa vs assassination, avoids bluffing dead characters, prefers Steal in 1v1 |

Bots make decisions with realistic delays and follow all the same rules as human players — they never peek at hidden cards. Hard bots use card counting (tracking publicly revealed cards) to make near-certain challenges when all copies of a character are accounted for.

## Game Rules

### Characters (3 copies each)

| Character | Action | Effect | Blocks |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Duke** | Tax | +3 coins | Foreign Aid |
| **Assassin** | Assassinate | Pay 3, target loses influence | — |
| **Captain** | Steal | Take 2 coins from target | Steal |
| **Ambassador** | Exchange | Draw 2 from deck, return 2 | Steal |
| **Contessa** | — | — | Assassination |

### General Actions

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Income** | +1 coin (safe — cannot be challenged or blocked) |
| **Foreign Aid** | +2 coins (blockable by Duke) |
| **Coup** | Pay 7 coins, target loses influence (unblockable, unchallengeable) |

### Core Mechanics

- **Bluffing** — claim any character action whether you hold that card or not
- **Challenging** — call someone's bluff. If they were honest, you lose an influence. If they lied, they lose one and the action is cancelled
- **Blocking** — certain characters counter certain actions. Blocks can themselves be challenged
- **Elimination** — lose both influences and you're out. Last player standing wins

## Architecture

The server is the single source of truth. Clients send intents (e.g. "play Tax") and receive filtered state — they can only see their own hidden cards and public information.

```
Client A                     Server                      Client B
   |                           |                            |
   |-- game:action (Tax) ----->|                            |
   |                           |-- ActionResolver (pure)    |
   |                           |-- Apply side effects       |
   |<-- game:state (filtered)--|-- game:state (filtered) -->|
```

The `ActionResolver` is a pure state machine: `(state, input) → (newPhase, sideEffects[])`. The `GameEngine` applies side effects (mutate coins, reveal cards, set timers) and broadcasts per-player views through `StateSerializer`.

### Turn Phase Flow

```
AwaitingAction
  ├─ Income ───────────────────────────> resolve ──> next turn
  ├─ Coup ─────────────────────────────> AwaitingInfluenceLoss ──> next turn
  ├─ Tax / Steal / Assassinate / Exchange
  │   └─> AwaitingActionChallenge
  │         ├─ Challenge ──> resolve
  │         └─ All Pass ──> AwaitingBlock (if blockable) or resolve
  └─ ForeignAid
      └─> AwaitingBlock
            ├─ Block ──> AwaitingBlockChallenge
            └─ All Pass ──> resolve
```

## Development

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start dev server (Express + Next.js + Socket.io) |
| `npm run build` | Build for production |
| `npm start` | Run production build |
| `npm test` | Run test suite (325 tests across 9 files) |
| `npm run test:watch` | Run tests in watch mode |

## Deployment

This project requires persistent WebSocket connections. **Vercel will not work** — use a platform that supports long-lived server processes.

### Recommended Platforms

- **[Railway](https://railway.app/)** — Git-based deploys, free tier available
- **[Render](https://render.com/)** — Web Service type with WebSocket support
- **[Fly.io](https://fly.io/)** — container-based, globally distributed

Set the build command to `npm run build` and the start command to `npm start`. The `PORT` environment variable is read automatically.
