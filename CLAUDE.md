# CLAUDE.md -- AI Assistant Context for Coup Online

This file provides context to help AI assistants (like Claude Code) work effectively on this codebase.

---

## Project Overview

Coup Online is a real-time multiplayer web adaptation of the card game Coup (2-6 players). Players bluff, challenge, and block to eliminate opponents' influences. The project is a full-stack TypeScript application with a server-authoritative architecture.

**Stack:** Next.js 15 (App Router) + Express + Socket.io + Zustand + Tailwind CSS + Vitest

---

## Running the Project

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server (Express + Next.js + Socket.io, all in one process)
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Production build
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

The dev server runs at `http://localhost:3000`. To test multiplayer, open multiple browser tabs.

## Key Architecture Decisions

### Server-Authoritative

All game logic runs on the server. Clients send intents (`game:action`, `game:challenge`, etc.) and receive filtered state. The client never computes game outcomes. This prevents cheating and ensures consistency.

### Engine Is Pure Logic

The `src/engine/` directory contains the core game rules with **no I/O, no timers, no Socket.io**. The `ActionResolver` is essentially a pure function: given the current game state and a player action, it returns a `ResolverResult` containing:

- `newPhase` -- the next turn phase
- Updated pending action/block/challenge/exchange/influence-loss state
- `sideEffects[]` -- a list of effects to apply (give coins, reveal card, advance turn, set timer, log, etc.)

The `GameEngine` orchestrates: it calls the resolver, then applies side effects to the mutable `Game` object. This separation makes the rules easy to test without mocking timers or sockets.

### State Serialization

The server holds full `GameState` (including the deck and all hidden cards). Before sending to a client, `StateSerializer.serializeForPlayer()` filters it into `ClientGameState`:

- Opponents' unrevealed cards become `{ character: null, revealed: false }`
- The deck array becomes just a count (`deckCount`)
- Exchange state is only sent to the player who is exchanging

### State Machine Phase Flow

The turn progresses through these phases (defined in `TurnPhase` enum):

1. `AwaitingAction` -- current player picks an action
2. `AwaitingActionChallenge` -- other players may challenge the claim
3. `AwaitingBlock` -- eligible players may block
4. `AwaitingBlockChallenge` -- original actor may challenge the block
5. `AwaitingInfluenceLoss` -- a player must choose a card to reveal
6. `AwaitingExchange` -- Ambassador player picks cards to keep
7. `ActionResolved` -- turn ends, advance to next player
8. `GameOver` -- winner determined

Not every turn visits every phase. Income resolves immediately. Coup skips to InfluenceLoss. The `ActionResolver` determines the path.

## Common Patterns

### Adding a New Game Action

1. Add the action to `ActionType` enum in `src/shared/types.ts`
2. Add its definition to `ACTION_DEFINITIONS` in `src/shared/constants.ts`
3. Handle it in `ActionResolver.declareAction()` and `ActionResolver.resolveAction()`
4. Add UI for it in `src/app/components/game/ActionBar.tsx`

### Adding a New Socket Event

1. Add the event signature to `ClientToServerEvents` or `ServerToClientEvents` in `src/shared/protocol.ts`
2. Add the handler in `src/server/SocketHandler.ts`
3. Add the client-side emit/listener in `src/app/hooks/useSocket.ts`

### Chat System

Room-scoped chat works in both lobby and in-game. Messages are stored server-side per room (up to `CHAT_MAX_HISTORY`), rate-limited to 1 per second per player, and sent to rejoining players via `chat:history`. In-game, the `GameCenterTabs` component provides Log and Chat tabs with an unread indicator.

### Rematch Flow

After a game finishes, the host can click "Play Again" which triggers `game:rematch` → server calls `resetToLobby()` (destroys engine, clears game state, removes disconnected players) → broadcasts `game:rematch_to_lobby` → all clients clear game state and redirect to the lobby. Chat history is preserved across rematches.

### Side Effect Pattern

The resolver never mutates game state directly. Instead, it returns side effects like:

```typescript
{ type: 'give_coins', playerId: '...', amount: 3 }
{ type: 'reveal_influence', playerId: '...', influenceIndex: 0 }
{ type: 'log', message: 'Alice collects Tax (+3 coins).' }
{ type: 'advance_turn' }
{ type: 'set_timer', durationMs: 15000 }
```

The `GameEngine.applySideEffect()` method interprets each effect and mutates the `Game` accordingly.

## Important Conventions

- **Server is authoritative** -- never add game logic to the client
- **Types live in `src/shared/`** -- do not define game types in engine or server files
- **Engine has no I/O** -- no `setTimeout`, no `socket.emit`, no `console.log` in `ActionResolver`. Timers and logging are expressed as side effects
- **All game constants** are in `src/shared/constants.ts` -- do not hardcode magic numbers
- **Room codes** are 6 characters using `ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZ23456789` (no ambiguous characters like O/0/I/1)
- **Player IDs** are UUIDs generated server-side
- **State broadcasts** go to every connected player in the room, each receiving their own filtered view

## Testing Tips

- Engine tests should test the `ActionResolver` and `Game` classes directly, without sockets
- Create players and a game programmatically, then call resolver methods and assert on the returned `ResolverResult`
- Use `vitest` -- the config is in `vitest.config.ts`
- Test edge cases: steal from player with 1 coin, exchange with 1 influence, forced coup at 10 coins, challenge on a truthful claim vs. a bluff
