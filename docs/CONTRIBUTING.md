## Reporting Bugs

Use the [Bug Report template](https://github.com/8tp/Coup/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml) to file a bug. The template will ask for:

1. **What happened** -- a clear, concise description of the bug
2. **Steps to reproduce** -- numbered steps to trigger the issue
3. **Device and browser** -- dropdown selectors
4. **Anything else** -- screenshots, room code, number of players, etc.

You can also report bugs directly from the in-app **Settings** modal (gear icon) via the "Report Bug" button.

Please search existing issues before creating a new one to avoid duplicates.

## Suggesting Features

Feature suggestions are welcome! Use the [Feedback / Feature Request template](https://github.com/8tp/Coup/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml) or click "Send Feedback" in the in-app **Settings** modal (gear icon). The template asks for:

1. **What would you like to see** -- describe your idea or feedback
2. **Category** -- Gameplay, UI/Design, Bots/AI, Mobile experience, or Other
3. **Anything else** -- mockups, examples, or additional context

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (LTS recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Git

### Getting Started

```bash
# Fork and clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/coup-online.git
cd coup-online

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

The development server runs at `http://localhost:3000` with hot reloading for both the Next.js frontend and the Express/Socket.io backend (via `tsx`).

### Project Layout

- `docs/` -- project documentation (CONTRIBUTING.md, PRD.md, BOT-STRATEGY.md)
- `tests/` -- test suite mirroring `src/` structure (`tests/engine/`, `tests/server/`, `tests/app/`)
- `src/shared/` -- types, constants, and protocol definitions shared between client and server
- `src/engine/` -- pure game logic with no I/O dependencies (start here if working on rules)
- `src/server/` -- Socket.io handlers, room management, state serialization
- `src/app/` -- Next.js App Router pages, components, hooks, stores, utils, and audio
- `server.ts` -- application entry point wiring Express, Socket.io, and Next.js

---

## Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript

- **Strict mode** is enabled (`strict: true` in `tsconfig.json`)
- Use explicit types for function parameters and return values in shared/engine code
- Prefer `interface` over `type` for object shapes
- Use `enum` for fixed sets of values (see `Character`, `ActionType`, `TurnPhase`)

### General Conventions

- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Keep functions focused -- single responsibility
- Engine code (`src/engine/`) must remain pure: no timers, no I/O, no Socket.io references. Side effects are expressed as data (`SideEffect[]`) and applied by the `GameEngine`
- Shared types go in `src/shared/types.ts`; do not import server-only or client-only code into shared modules
- All game constants (costs, timers, player limits) live in `src/shared/constants.ts`

### File Naming

- React components: `PascalCase.tsx`
- Hooks: `useCamelCase.ts`
- Stores: `camelCaseStore.ts`
- Engine/server classes: `PascalCase.ts`

### Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for all styling
- Follow the existing dark theme and color conventions
- Touch targets must be at least 48px for mobile usability

## Pull Request Process

1. **Create a branch** from `main` with a descriptive name:
   - `feature/add-spectator-mode`
   - `fix/steal-zero-coins-crash`
   - `refactor/extract-timer-logic`

2. **Make your changes** with clear, focused commits

3. **Run tests** and make sure they pass:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

4. **Test manually** with at least 2 browser tabs to verify multiplayer behavior

5. **Open a Pull Request** against `main` with:
   - A clear title summarizing the change
   - A description of what changed and why
   - Screenshots or recordings for UI changes
   - Notes on any edge cases tested

6. **Address review feedback** -- maintainers may request changes before merging

### PR Checklist

- [ ] Tests pass (`npm test`)
- [ ] No TypeScript errors (`npx tsc --noEmit`)
- [ ] Tested with multiple players in the browser
- [ ] No console errors or warnings in the browser
- [ ] Game rules remain accurate (if engine code changed)
